		  stimuli: one color signaled a standard food reward and the
		  other a reward that adjusted in magnitude according to the
		  birds choices: it increased when the standard was preferred
		  and decreased when the adjusting option was preferred.
		  There were 2 standards of 3 and 9 units of food, each of
		  which was delivered at 2 rates to control for possible
		  effects of rate of reinforcement on discrimination. Results
		  show that the observed value of the adjusting option
		  oscillated around a mean value slightly larger than that of
		  the standard. The probability of choosing the larger
		  alternative increased as the relative difference between
		  the adjusting option and standard increased. Thus, Webers
		  Law was relevant to starlings memories for amounts of food.

		  When in oestrus, females were groomed more frequently by
		  males than at other times. Therewas an indication that
		  females were groomed especially by those males with whom
		  thet mayted more often. No difference was found in the
		  males tendency to share food with females in oestrud or
		  anoestrus condition. Further, clear disadvantages were
		  associated with being in oestrus: females received support
		  from males less frequently and were more often involved in
		  conflicts with males than in their anoestrus period. Higher
		  ranking males did not mate more often. No relatioship was

		  with a given female and her dominance rank, age of parity,
		  nor did he support her or share food more often with her}

		  learning in such systems. It argues that both kinds of
		  learning depend on gradual connection weight adjustment
		  through repeated and interleaved presentation to
		  representative samples of the structure of the domains to
		  which they apply. The following questions are examined: How
		  is semantic memory organized in the brain; is it by
		  category or by modality; and why is there a special system,
		  namely the hippocampus, dedicated to the rapid acquisition
		  of episodic memories? (French abstract) (PsycLIT Database

		  the unreinforced stimulus (S-). Testing after 24 hrs

		  no such effect. Exps II and III (48 Ss) further revealed

		  The parameters, snout vent length, body length (from snout
		  to tail tip), and proportion of snout vent length to body
		  size were larger in the female than the male. Five physical
		  parameters in males were significantly correlated with one
		  another, body length, snout vent length, head width, tail
		  vent length, and tail depth, while all, except tail depth,
		  were significantly correlated in females. Sexual behavior
		  of H. leechii involved external fertilization and consisted
		  of three stages, identifying the female, attracting the
		  female, and insemination. The identification stage
		  consisted of a positive advance by the male toward the
		  female and display of snout contact. The male attracted the
		  female with chin rubbing, tail undulation, smelling, and
		  digging displays. The insemination process consisted of
		  four phases, amplex, separating egg sacs from the females
		  cloacal, fertilizing eggs, and post fertilization. Fighting
		  behaviors were quite simple. The attacking male would
		  generally bite the opposite males upper chin or hind limbs
		  and then shakes his head two or three times. The bitten
		  male, which in most cases was of a dissimilar body size,
		  quickly escaped from the attacking male. After fighting,
		  winning male usually displayed rapid tail undulation}

		  learning requires the direct investigation of discriminated
		  response and reinforcer (incentive) processes acquired
		  exclusively through the response-reinforcer contingencies
		  operating on complex (multicomponent) baselines. Two series
		  of stimulus-compounding studies accomplished this direct
		  investigation. In the 1st series, the independent variable
		  was the relative reinforcement between schedule components;
		  in the 2nd series, it was relative response rate between
		  components. Results of stimulus-compounding tests show that
		  response and incentive processes enhanced each other when
		  in agreement, counteracted each other when in opposition,
		  and produced intermediate results when only 1 factor was
		  operating. This pattern of results led to the conclusion
		  that response and incentive processes were algebraically
		  combining and to the development of a response/incentive
		  matrix reflecting these dynamics. This 2-factor analysis
		  was extended to the peak-shift effect in stimulus
		  generalization experiments and to the generation of
		  inhibitory control. Two decades of stimulus compounding and
		  peak-shift research were organized within this 2-factor
		  framework, extending this traditional approach to learning
		  to active research areas heretofore not systematically
		  considered in these terms. (41/2 p ref) (PsycLIT Database
